# ToDo
 - Commands to implement
   - Ability to check off commands
   - Make it print a table with:
     - the current user and the tasks they still have
     - the current month with all the users and tasks that need to be done
   - When asked, it responds with the current resposible for the week
 - On a schedule
   - Reminder 2 days before week ends
   - Reminder the last day before week ends
   - Print table when a person's duty ends (Maybe calculate a score)
   - Start the week by mentioning the new person's shift and print their table
 - Add bi-weekly, monthly and asynchronous tasks
 - Investigate Supabase / Postgres database naming convention (snake_case vs camelCase)

# Ideas
 - Implement a system to estimate each task duration and their importance
   - could be done using emojiis here or other symbols
 - Detect when scheduler gets a message to shut down (Ctrl + C) and send a message, "Bot shutting down..." for example.
 - Create an MVP
